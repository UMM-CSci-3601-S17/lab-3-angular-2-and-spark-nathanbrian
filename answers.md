Q: Notice anything new in our .gitignore? There are actually multiple .gitignore files in this project, can you find 
   them all?
A: We found 3 .gitignore files. In addition to the original one there is one in the client and server directories.
   The yarn things and node_modules are new.
   
Q: Note also that there are now multiple build.gradle files as well! Why is this?
A: There are multiples files because there are multiple servers, we believe that the one outside of the client and 
   server directories activates the other two.
   
Q: What are a couple of these new tools? What do you think they do?
A: Angular2, Yarn, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. Angular2 is a framework for CSS and javascript, TypeScript is a language
   that implements javascript while still including typing and object-orientation. We don't know what Yarn and Bootstrap
   are for.
